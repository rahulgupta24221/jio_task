# Project Name-  Books Directory

# Instructions

1-Run npm install -g @nestjs/cli command inside the project
2-For development run npm run start:dev


# Problem Statement

The most basic project you can create using Node.js  and  Nest.js and Mongodb is a simple REST API.

I have build a book directory, where you would need to create endpoints, using the four most basic methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

You’d use GET for getting all books or getting only one book by id. With the POST method, you can add a new book to the list. You’d need the PUT method for updating the existing book, and it’s evident that with the DELETE method, you will remove the book from the list.

I have also use authentication part and here I am using Guard

For this kind of application, I  have  use the database, and  you can start with data collected in the database
